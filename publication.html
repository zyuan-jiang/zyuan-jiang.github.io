		<span style="color: blue">Predicting Alzheimerâ€™s disease in prodromal-stage by multimodal convolutional recurrent neural</span><br /></li>
		We proposed an interpretative multi-modalities model for AD classifying problem. This model is constituted by a convolutional recurrent neural network that resolves time-sequential PET images for extracting spatiotemporal correlation, and a multilayer perceptron disposes of other correlation information of subjects such as the apolipoprotein E allele. Results indicate that our model can classify AD patients, MCI subjects with CN group for over 86% accuracy on 1671 subjects with 7280 test images.<br>
		We use data from <a href="https://ida.loni.usc.edu/">here</a>.<br>

		<li><span style="color: blue">
		A Survey of Traffic shaping Applications in Privacy protection</span><br />
		In Prof.Xue's course <em>Network Security Protocol</em>, I did literature review with my friend Lili Tang.<br>
		We implement a simple Python demo for both Leaky Bucket Algorithm and Token Bucket Algorithm. Moreover, we demonstrate the vulnerability of privacy through traffic analysis in IoT net, and enumerate some specific attacks to that, such as, Hidden Markov Model and Machine Learning clustering Algorithm. We summarize the traditional methods against traffic analysis attacks and further point out the pros and cons of them. Finally, we evaluate its feasibility in real network scenario and propose our methods to optimize its implementation and deployment.<br>

		<li><span style="color: blue">Digital Human figure portal</span><br />
		Under the guidance of Prof.Lu, I worked independently to solve <em>Image matting</em> problem. I cloned code of DeepLabv3, PlaneNet and ScanNet from Github. Then I modified the code and apply it to this project.<br />
		Finally, I received the Certificate of Completion from Microsoft Research Asia.</li>

		<li><span style="color: blue">Amplifier nonlinear distortion research device</span><br />
		I worked together with my friends Henan Wang and Wen Sun in my second year in USTC. Our cooperation was very pleasant, and each of us learned much from other. After two months' training, during which we spent all our leisure time in Lab, we had successfully designed smart glasses and Automatic balancing board. Then we used software to simulate the nonlinear distortion.<br>

		Next, we combined basic electronic components to make the real simulator, and tested it on an oscilloscope. The result was extremely good and interesting.<br></li>

		Finally, our group got third prize in National Undergraduate Electronics Design Contest in China, Anhui province. I was proud of our fruit and my two excellent teammates.
